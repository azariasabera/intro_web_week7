The game is to crash as many enemy ships as possible. 
The enemy will be firing at the same direction constantly.
Try trajectoring the bullets and also try to collect shield so you won't get hit too much.
For enemy ships it takes 200 fires to crash while for the player it is 1000.

Shoot with space key

Collectable assets:
- Coin => 1pt each
- Star => 3pts each
- Shield => 0pt (used to destroy more ships without getting hit)
- Heart => 0pt (removes 200 pts from player hit count!)

Main task: to crash as many ships as possible => 30pts each

NB - shield works only for 7 seconds
